This is a "Bluetooth Explorer" app that was written in order to develop a general-purpose Core Bluetooth "Wrapper" SDK, and learn Bluetooth.

[This is the GitHub repo for this project.](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/BlueVanClef) It is 100% open-source, MIT-licensed code.

Although this is an iOS app, it will be used to develop a cross-platform SDK.

It is destined to become an Apple App-Store app, but that's still a ways off, and Apple needs to greenlight it _(They can sometimes be a bit "squeamish" with developer tools like this)_.
